# Data Mining in Medicine: Predicting Outcomes after the Onset of Stroke
- Programming Project for Elective Course CS 176 (Data Mining)
- Data mining techniques to build models to predict  the status of the patient 6 months after the onset of stroke. 
- We built decision tree models, generated association rules, and analyzed the accuracy of the models produced by the C5.0 algorithm and the CART model

# Objectives
The objectives of this Mini Project are as follows:
- To write R code that uses C5.0 algorithm to generate a decision tree
model and a set of association rules for the The International Stroke
Trial (IST) Data Set that predicts the status of the patient 6 months
after the onset of stroke.
- To analyze the generated decision tree and association rules and to
report the accuracy of the classification model.
- To gain a deeper understanding of data mining through classification
and to apply the predictive model to a real world application, specifically in the medical field.

# Documentation
A comprehensive documentation of the project can be viewed in `report.pdf`.
